                <p>Planetary motion is an interactable art piece and soundscape that changes 
                    as the planets move closer to each other. The coding used to detect motion 
                    and respond accordingly was done in Max. The piece was displayed at the 
                    BlackBox Theater in the ATLAS building.</p>

                <div style="padding:56.34% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/909618684?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Planetary Motion Soundscape"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
                
                <p>Sound does not travel in outer space. Planetary Motion aims to take a purely visual phenomena, the orbits of the 
                    planets, and represent it with audio. Each planet pairing was assigned a song, 
                    and as the pairing gets closer together, their song plays louder.</p>

                <div class = "doubleimgbox">
                    <img src = "./images/planet-1.jpg">
                    <img src = "./images/planet-2.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>The piece was set up and presented in a space that allows for motion tracking. 
                    Each of the planets have 4 reflective orbs on them, which can be tracked with 
                    infrared. We then used code in Max to calculate distances between objects 
                    and compute volume accordingly. The lights in the theater shift from blue to
                    purple subtly, and we projected stars onto the walls of the space.</p>

                <p>The planets are suspended using steel wire attached to a PVC frame. The structure
                    mimics a mobile, much like a child would have above their crib. There are 2 arms,
                    so the planets move in pairs. 
                </p>

                <p>We allowed the public to experience our art piece and move the planets freely.
                    Our idea was received positively, and we received feedback, such as improving the orbital mechanism,
                    in case we want to re-imagine our idea at a later time.
