                <p>Dinogotchi is a fun interactive toy! He's fully wired up so you 
                    can nurture and feed him. He's programmed using a Micro:bit, his 
                    hardware is soldered, and his body was 3D printed.</p>

                <p>Atlas Zaina and I were tasked with creating some sort of interactive, creative object.
                    So, we decided to design the 
                    dinogotchi, a tamagotchi-esque interactive toy. The dinogotchi is 
                    sitting on his back legs, with a big smile. Each of his arms have a 
                    button in the center, and his mouth has a screen in the middle. He 
                    was 3D printed and is, as a result, bright blue and black, as we were 
                    unable to print him entirely in the same color. We jokingly said he 
                    looked like he was frankensteined together, but decided to roll with 
                    it as a theme. He has stitches on the seams between two different colors, 
                    and lots of spots. At just under 9 inches tall, he's a small friend.</p>

                <div class = "doubleimgbox">
                    <img src = "./images/dino-1.png">
                    <img src = "./images/dino-2.png">
                </div>

                <p>His inner mechanisms are made from a microbit board, wires, two large 
                    buttons we came across, a prototyping board, and a micro-usb cable. 
                    The cable provides power to the microbit board, which has a grid of 
                    LEDs on it. These LEDs are programmed to light up in different patterns 
                    to emulate a screen.</p>

                <p>Our dinogotchi is intended to be a source of entertainment. Both my groupmate 
                    and I have fond memories of tamagotchis, so we wanted to draw inspiration 
                    from our nostalgia while also creating something new. Upon turning on the 
                    toy, he will display a heart symbol, since he is happy to play with you. One 
                    of his buttons allows you to feed him, after which he will go to sleep. The 
                    other button allows you to hydrate him, which will also cause him to fall asleep 
                    afterwards. If you tilt him to the left, he will display a music note. If you 
                    tilt him to the right, he will display a different music note. This is how you 
                    play with him and keep him happy.</p>
