                <p>Solar Stones is part of a collaboration centered around the study 
                    of the sun. Our team re-created rock carvings used to study ancient 
                    astronomy. The carved tablets were 3D printed, molded, cast in resin, 
                    then implemented into a larger educational exhibit. Exhibit posters were
                    created in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                <p>Solar Stones is a collaborative project between a team of fabrication 
                    specialists, NASA, the SouthWest Research Institute, and FISKE 
                    Planetarium. It is part of the NASA 
                    PUNCH mission's outreach program. The project received a <a class = "noline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL_UHz33m5Y">
                    short TV segment</a> as well as a <a class = 'noline' href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/punch/2024/08/13/nasas-punch-mission-touches-the-sun-with-solar-stones/">
                    blog post on NASA's website</a>.

                <p>There are two petroglyphs the project highlights: One of a spiral, and one of 
                    a curlicue shape which could be interpreted as a solar eclipse.
                    The spiral carving interacts with the summer 
                    solstice, and the curlicue carving could be a communal record of a total 
                    solar eclipse.
                    </p>

                <p>The carvings are located in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. This is the home of the current 
                    Puebloan people, descended from
                    the Ancient Puebloan people who inhabitated the area 1000 years ago.
                    It has been documented that these people studied and tracked the sun, using 
                    it to guide festivities and keep track of time. The current
                    Puebloans have allowed the outreach team to document and re-create replicas of
                    some of their solar petroglyphs, which are an important part of 
                    their culture and history.</p>
               
                <p>The carvings in Chaco Canyon are now protected and 
                    closed off to the public for conservation and preservation of history. They are only accessible through 
                    images and visual mediums.
                    This limits these ancient stellar stories to a purely visual experience, and 
                    excludes blind and low vision learners.</p>

                <p>Solar Stones creates a way for everyone to be able to learn about 
                    the Puebloan culture, and to be able to experience the 
                    wonder of space and history in a new way. These 3D, tactile representations of 
                    the petroglyphs make this intersectionality
                    of native science and culture accessible to the public, and now include blind and
                    low vision learners. The 3d model files are <a class = "noline" href="https://punch.space.swri.edu/punch_outreach_3D-prints.php">
                    free to download on NASA's website</a> so that they can be an easy to fabricate learning tool.
                    The site also includes detailed instructions on how to 3D print
                    the petroglyph tactiles, created to help those new to 3d printing.</p>
