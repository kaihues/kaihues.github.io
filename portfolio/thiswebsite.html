                    done by me as well.

                <p>I code websites! So when I felt like I needed a more updated
                    portfolio and personal website, I decided to hand code it myself.
                    The site uses html, css, and javascript so that it is reactive and 
                    looks nice. The style of the site is a modern, pop art inspired version of the retro
                    internet aesthetic, which features pop up window boxes and text 
                    symbols. It's something I grew up with, and feel is a large part
                    of my personality and inspiration as an artist.

                <p>The site originally started as a site to host assignments and 
                    miscellaneous coding projects, but I decided to pivot and give 
                    the site a revamp. I'm constantly working on improving this 
                    site and making it more reactive and fun!
