                <p>This beginner friendly 3D printing guide was designed in Google Slides. The 3D model was created with Paint3D and Blender, and the background was drawn in FireAlpaca.</p>

                <p>3D printing is a valueable skill, but many people feel intimidated
                    while trying to learn it or get lost in the many different terms.
                    I wanted to create a short, introductory guide to teach others the 
                    basics of 3D printing and make it more accessible. It starts off by telling others what 
                    options they have for 3D printing (printing something themselves vs
                    outsourcing a 3D print with a service) and walks them through how to 
                    print something themselves. The guide explains the basic terms needed
                    to slice and understand a 3D print. 
                </p>

                <p>The guide features a small dinosaur 3D model I made, and shows
                    what it looks like when 3D printed with different filaments as 
                    well as painted with acrylic paint.
