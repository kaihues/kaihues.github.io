                <p>The Ice Age Arcade machine was designed to teach players how 
                    ice ages are formed. A hardworking team built the machine from 
                    the ground up- coding, woodworking, graphic design and all.</p>

                <p>The Ice Age Arcade is an exhibit designed to represent the 
                    relationship between Milankovitch cycles and ice ages in an 
                    inclusive, all-ages format, with a familiar design of an arcade 
                    game. The visitors to the exhibit would be presented with a 3D 
                    orbital model of the Earth around the Sun, which they can manipulate 
                    with a goal of obtaining the Milankovitch cycle conditions 
                    appropriate for the start of a Glacial Maximum (ice age). Once achieved, 
                    they will witness the climatic conditions during the last ice age 
                    through snowfall visualization and the formation of the Laurentide 
                    Ice Sheet over present-day Manhattan, NY.</p>
