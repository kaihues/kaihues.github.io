                <p>Beats and Cats is a project made in React.js. Artwork was done in Medibang Paint and 
                    website was coded using html, css, and javascript.

                <p>This project was made to experiement with using the React.js framework.
                    It features four cats, all of which play a different song. The "cat" 
                    framework and coding is the same for all 4 cats, and the individual sprites
                    and songs are passed into it four separate times to create the different
                    cats. 
                </p>

                <p>We originally hoped to incorporate Spotify's API, but it didn't make
                    the final cut due to the fact that some songs do not have a 30
                    second preview and as such the cat code would break. However, it's a 
                    feature we hope to include in the future.
