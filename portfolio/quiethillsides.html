                <p>Quiet Hillsides utilizes a computer program to generate a nostalgic 
                    art piece with a few randomized elements. The art is visualized using 
                    Turtle Graphics, and the code needed to draw it is in Python.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Each time the code is run, the computer will generate slightly randomized 
                    flowers. Certain elements, such as the way the stems look and the size of 
                    the petals, use variables that are randomized. This then insures that each 
                    piece will look slightly different, and will have a sense of uniqueness much 
                    like real flowers do. Quiet hillsides draws upon a childlike fascination 
                    with dandelions, and creates art to convey that nostalgia.</p>

                <p>Different iterations of the project experimented with what elements were to 
                    be randomized during each drawing. Originally, many elements were randomized, 
                    but that led to a chaotic landscape with conflicting colors. The final code 
                    has a set palette and many small random elements, so the final art piece looks 
                    aesthetically pleasing.</p>
